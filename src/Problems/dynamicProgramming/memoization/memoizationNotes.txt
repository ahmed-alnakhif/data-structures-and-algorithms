Memoization Recipe

1) make it work
    - visualize the problem as a tree
    - implement the tree using recursion 
    - test it 

2) make it efficient
    - add a memo map
    - add a base case to return memo map
    - store return values into memo map

Side Nodes: 
    - if we want to allow using the choice more than once, then don't add the "not include case" 
    - if we don't want to allow using the choice more than once, then use an index
