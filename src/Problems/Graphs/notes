Graph:
  - it's the relationship between nodes.
  - Graph = nodes + edges
  - e.g: nodes are courses and edges are prerequisites, nodes are cities and
    edges are the roads

Edge/Vertex:
  - it's the connection between nodes

Directed Graph:
  - edges have a direction

Undirected Graph:
  - no direction between nodes

Neighbor nodes:
  - nodes that are connected with an edge

Ways to represent graphs:
  1) adjacency list
  2) adjacency matrix
  3) adjacency set

Notes: 
  - when solving a graph problem, start by identifying the type of graph
    - directed vs undirected
    - weighted vs unweighted
    - cyclic vs acyclic
  - Example: 
    - unweighted -> BFS
    - weighted with positive edges -> Dijkstra's Alg.
    - weighted with negative edges -> Bellman Ford's Alg.
    
TODO: 
  - Prim's or Kruskal's (minimum spanning tree)
  - Floyd Warshall's Algo. (very rare)
