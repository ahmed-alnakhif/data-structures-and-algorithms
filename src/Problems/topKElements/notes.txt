When to use Top K elements pattern?
    - when the question asks for top / largest / smallest / most frequent K elements 

Ways to solve problems that fall under this patter:
    - when the question asks for K smallest, we use max heap
    - when the question asks for K largest, we use min heap

Steps: 
    1. choose min/max heap
    2. ordering criteria
        - file size
        - distance to origin
        - frequency 
    3. iterate on all elements and fill the heap up to size K 

Examples: 
    1) Kth largest elements in an array
    2) top K frequent elements
    3) top K frequent words
    4) kth largest element in a stream
    5) K closest points to origin 
    6) sort character by frequenecy
    7) rearrange string K distant apart
    8) reorganize string
    9) task scheduler 
    10) find K closest points
    11) frequency stack
