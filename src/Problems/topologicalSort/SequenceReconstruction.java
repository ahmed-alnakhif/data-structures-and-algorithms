/**
 * You are given an integer array nums of length n where nums is a permutation
 * of the integers in the range [1, n]. You are also given a 2D integer array
 * sequences where sequences[i] is a subsequence of nums.
 * 
 * Check if nums is the shortest possible and the only supersequence. The
 * shortest supersequence is a sequence with the shortest length and has all
 * sequences[i] as subsequences. There could be multiple valid supersequences
 * for the given array sequences.
 * 
 * For example, for sequences = [[1,2],[1,3]], there are two shortest
 * supersequences, [1,2,3] and [1,3,2].
 * While for sequences = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,2,3]], the only shortest supersequence
 * possible is [1,2,3]. [1,2,3,4] is a possible supersequence but not the
 * shortest.
 * Return true if nums is the only shortest supersequence for sequences, or
 * false otherwise.
 * 
 * A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by
 * deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining
 * elements.
