What's Topological Sort?
    - a way to solve problems where some events may occurs before others 
    - problems usually are represented as graphs with directed edges.
    - gives us a topological ordering:
        - an ordering of the nodes in a directed graph where for each directed edge 
          from node A to node B, node A appears before node B in the ordering 
    - can find a topological ordering in O(V+E) time.
    - topological orderings are not unique 
    - not every graph can have a topological ordering; graphs that have a cycle. 
    - the only graph which has a valid topological ordering is a directed acyclic graphs (graphs with directed edges and no cycles)
    - every tree has a topological ordering since they don't have a cycle 
    - Algorithm: 
        1. pick an unvisited node
        2. perform a dfs exploring only unvisited nodes
        3. on the dfs recursive callback, add the current node to the topological ordering in reverse order

        1. school class prerequisites 
        2. program dependencies
        3. event scheduling 
        4. assembly instructions
