We usually use two heaps pattern when: 
    1. we want to divide something to two parts.
        - first part end is max heap
        - second part start is min heap
        - examples: 
            - median 

    2. we have to properties that are proportional to each other
        - want to find the max value with the min resources 
        - value would be a max heap and resource would be a min heap 
        - examples: 
            - min costs to hire k workers
            - min capital to gain max profit  
            
    3. one property depends on another property
