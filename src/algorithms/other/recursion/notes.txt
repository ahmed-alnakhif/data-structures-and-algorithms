# Recursion: 
    When to use recursion?
        for problems that contains smaller instances of the same problem
    
    Anatomy of Recursion:
        - Base Case:
            the "smallest" instance of a problem that's solved trivially

        - Recursive Case:
            an instance of a problem that shrinks the size of the input toward the base case 


# Combination: 
    What is a Combination? 
        - a collection of things where the order does NOT matter
        - take the decision whether or not we include an element 
        - given a set of n things, there are 2^n possible combinations 

    Common Questions: 
        - given n things, in how many ways can we arrange them
        - in how many ways can we do X
        - what's the shortest way to do Y


# Permutation:
    What is a Permutation? 
        - a collection of things where the order matters
        - definitely incluse an element, but choosing where to place it exactly
        - given a set of n things, there are n! possible permutations

    - add recursive tree for all above
