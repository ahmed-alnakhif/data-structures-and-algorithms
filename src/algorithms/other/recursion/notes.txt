When to use recursion?
    for problems that contains smaller instances of the same problem
  
Anatomy of Recursion:
    # Base Case:
        - the "smallest" instance of a problem that's solved trivially

    # Recursive Case:
        - an instance of a problem that shrinks the size of the input toward the base case
